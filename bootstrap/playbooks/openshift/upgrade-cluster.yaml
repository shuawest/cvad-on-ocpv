  # During the upgrade process, nodes in the cluster might become temporarily unavailable. 
  # In the case of worker nodes, the machine health check might identify such nodes as 
  # unhealthy and reboot them. To avoid rebooting such nodes, pause all the 
  # MachineHealthCheck resources before updating the cluster.

  # Add the paused annoation to the mhc resource
